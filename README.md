# Projects on Machine Learning

## Introduction
Machine Learning has always been a subject of greater interest for data enthusiasts. Being on the supply chain side, I also wanted to explore the multifarious breakthroughs of data analytics in my core sector. It all started with a robust mixture of self interest and Hard work to push the limits for understanding the actual gist of data science.

Real estate from the ages is considered to be one of the most profitable sector. However, its never-ending uncertainties and variations makes historical data abstruse and difficult to predict the future sales and property rates. Here come python machine learning packages for developing a model for predicting the actual prices of houses. Right from data acquisition to building pipelines and performing ridge regression, every scenario caters to remove the end contingencies available in raw data. This constitutes great introduction to data manipulation and analysis  and allows to gain a full fledged  understanding of Python syntax, specifically the pandas library.
